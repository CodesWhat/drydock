## Overview

Drydock provides direct container management actions through both the UI and API. These actions let you control containers without leaving the drydock interface.

## Available actions

| Action | API endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Start** | `POST /api/containers/:id/start` | Start a stopped container |
| **Stop** | `POST /api/containers/:id/stop` | Stop a running container |
| **Restart** | `POST /api/containers/:id/restart` | Restart a container |
| **Update** | `POST /api/containers/:id/update` | Pull new image and recreate container |
| **Delete** | `DELETE /api/containers/:id` | Remove container from drydock tracking |

## Feature flags

Container actions can be individually toggled with environment variables:

| Env var | Required | Description | Supported values | Default value when missing |
| --- | :---: | --- | --- | --- |
| `DD_SERVER_FEATURE_CONTAINERACTIONS` | ⚪ | Enable start, stop, restart, and update actions | `true`, `false` | `true` |
| `DD_SERVER_FEATURE_DELETE` | ⚪ | Enable container deletion | `true`, `false` | `true` |

<Callout type="info">When a feature flag is disabled, the corresponding buttons are hidden in the UI and the API endpoints return `403 Forbidden`.</Callout>

## Update action

The update action triggers the Docker trigger for the selected container. It will:

1. Pull the latest image
2. Backup the current image
3. Run lifecycle hooks (if configured)
4. Stop and remove the current container
5. Create and start the new container
6. Monitor health (if auto-rollback is enabled)

See [Lifecycle Hooks](/docs/configuration/hooks) and [Backup & Rollback](/docs/configuration/rollback) for related configuration.

## Preview

Before updating, you can preview what will change using the dry-run endpoint:

`POST /api/containers/:id/preview`

This returns the proposed changes without executing them.

## Metrics

All container actions are tracked via Prometheus counters. See [Monitoring](/docs/monitoring) for details.

## Example — disable all actions

```yaml
services:
  drydock:
    image: codeswhat/drydock
    environment:
      - DD_SERVER_FEATURE_CONTAINERACTIONS=false
      - DD_SERVER_FEATURE_DELETE=false
```
