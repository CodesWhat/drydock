The `dockercompose` trigger lets you update docker-compose.yml files & replace existing containers with their updated versions.

The trigger will:

- Update the related docker-compose.yml file
- Clone the existing container specification
- Pull the new image
- Stop the existing container
- Remove the existing container
- Create the new container
- Start the new container (if the previous one was running)
- Run `post_start` hooks declared on the updated service (if any)
- Remove the previous image (optionally)

## Variables

| Env var | Required | Description | Supported values | Default value when missing |
| --- | :---: | --- | --- | --- |
| `DD_TRIGGER_DOCKERCOMPOSE_{trigger_name}_FILE` | 🔴 | The docker-compose.yml file location | | |
| `DD_TRIGGER_DOCKERCOMPOSE_{trigger_name}_BACKUP` | ⚪ | Backup the docker-compose.yml file as `.back` before updating? | `true`, `false` | `false` |
| `DD_TRIGGER_DOCKERCOMPOSE_{trigger_name}_PRUNE` | ⚪ | If the old image must be pruned after upgrade | `true`, `false` | `false` |
| `DD_TRIGGER_DOCKERCOMPOSE_{trigger_name}_DRYRUN` | ⚪ | When enabled, only pull the new image ahead of time | `true`, `false` | `false` |
| `DD_TRIGGER_DOCKERCOMPOSE_{trigger_name}_COMPOSEFILELABEL` | ⚪ | Container label name used to locate the compose file per container | Label name | `dd.compose.file` |

<Callout type="info">This trigger also supports the [common configuration variables](/docs/configuration/triggers/#common-trigger-configuration). but only supports the `batch` mode.</Callout>

<Callout type="info">Legacy compatibility: compose file label fallback `wud.compose.file` is still accepted when `dd.compose.file` is not present. Prefer `dd.compose.file` for new configs, and use `node dist/index.js config migrate` to rewrite existing labels.</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">This trigger will only work with locally watched containers.</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">Do not forget to mount the docker-compose.yml file in the drydock container.</Callout>

## Compose file patch behavior

When a tag-based update requires a compose file change, Drydock patches Compose content in a service-scoped way:

- Only the target `services.<service>.image` value is edited.
- Comments and surrounding formatting are preserved outside that scalar value.
- Drydock does not use global string replacement for image tags, so matching strings in other fields (for example environment values) are not rewritten.

<Callout type="info">If a service uses flow-style mapping without an `image` key (for example `nginx: { restart: always }`), Drydock will not auto-insert `image`. Convert that service to block-style YAML first.</Callout>

## Troubleshooting: `permission denied` (`EACCES`)

If logs show an error like:

```text
EACCES: permission denied, access '/drydock/.../docker-compose.yml'
```

the mounted compose file (or parent directory) is not writable by the Drydock process. This trigger needs read and write access to update image tags in the compose file.

Ways to fix:

- Grant read and write access on the mounted path for the user/group used by the Drydock container.
- Add the host group that owns the compose files with `group_add` so Drydock can read and write them.
- Break-glass workaround (less secure): set both `DD_RUN_AS_ROOT=true` and `DD_ALLOW_INSECURE_ROOT=true`; setting only `DD_RUN_AS_ROOT=true` fails closed at startup.

Example using `group_add`:

```yaml
services:
  drydock:
    image: codeswhat/drydock
    group_add:
      - "${COMPOSE_FILES_GID}"
    volumes:
      - /var/lib/docker/volumes/portainer_data/_data/compose:/drydock
    environment:
      - DD_TRIGGER_DOCKERCOMPOSE_EXAMPLE_FILE=/drydock/5/docker-compose.yml
```

<Callout type="info">`COMPOSE_FILES_GID` should match the GID that owns the mounted compose files on the host.</Callout>
<Callout type="warn">Do **not** mount the compose file as read-only (`:ro`) — the trigger must write updated image tags back to the file.</Callout>
