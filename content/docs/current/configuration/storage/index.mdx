If you want the state to persist after the container removal, you need to mount  ```/store``` as a volume.

## Examples

<Tabs items={["Docker Compose", "Docker"]}>
<Tab value="Docker Compose">

```yaml
services:
  drydock:
    image: codeswhat/drydock
    ...
    volumes:
      - /path-on-my-host:/store
```

</Tab>
<Tab value="Docker">
```bash
docker run \
  -v /path-on-my-host:/store
  ...
  codeswhat/drydock
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
