## Server Log Configuration

Control drydock's own log output with environment variables.

### Variables

| Env var | Required | Description | Supported values | Default value when missing |
| ---------------- | :--------------: | ----------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `DD_LOG_LEVEL` | ⚪ | Log level | error info debug trace | `info` |
| `DD_LOG_FORMAT` | ⚪ | Log format | text json | `text` |

### Examples

#### Set debug level

<Tabs items={["Docker Compose (Debug Level)", "Docker (Debug Level)"]}>
<Tab value="Docker Compose (Debug Level)">

```yaml
services:
  drydock:
    image: codeswhat/drydock
    ...
    environment:
      - DD_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

</Tab>
<Tab value="Docker (Debug Level)">
```bash
docker run -e DD_LOG_LEVEL=debug ... codeswhat/drydock
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Set json format (for ElasticSearch ingestion for example)

<Tabs items={["Docker (JSON Format)", "Docker Compose (JSON Format)"]}>
<Tab value="Docker (JSON Format)">

```bash
docker run -e DD_LOG_FORMAT=json ... codeswhat/drydock
```

</Tab>
<Tab value="Docker Compose (JSON Format)">
```yaml
services:
  drydock:
    image: codeswhat/drydock
    ...
    environment:
      - DD_LOG_FORMAT=json
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Application Log Viewer

The **Configuration > Logs** page provides a terminal-style viewer for drydock's own runtime logs — startup events, polling cycles, registry checks, trigger executions, and errors.

Logs are stored in an in-memory ring buffer (last 1,000 entries). They are not persisted to disk.

### Toolbar controls

| Control | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Level** | Filter by log level: `all`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`. Note: entries below your configured `DD_LOG_LEVEL` are never captured, so they won't appear regardless of this filter. |
| **Lines** | Number of entries to fetch: 50, 100, 500, or 1,000. |
| **Auto fetch** | Automatically poll for new entries at a chosen interval: Off, 2s, 5s, 10s, or 30s. |
| **Refresh** | Manual one-shot fetch. |

### Scroll lock

When auto fetch is active, the viewer auto-scrolls to the newest entry after each fetch. If you scroll up to read earlier entries, **scroll lock** activates automatically — a warning chip appears and auto-scroll pauses so your reading position is preserved. Click **Resume** to jump back to the bottom and re-enable auto-scroll.

## Container Log Viewer

Each container has a **Logs** tab in its detail expansion panel. This shows the container's stdout/stderr output directly in the UI — no need to shell into the host.

### Toolbar controls

| Control | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Lines** | Number of tail lines to fetch: 50, 100, or 500. |
| **Auto fetch** | Poll for new log output at a chosen interval: Off, 2s, 5s, 10s, or 30s. |
| **Refresh** | Manual one-shot fetch. |

Scroll lock and resume work the same way as the application log viewer.

### Agent containers

Container logs work for both local and remote agent containers. For agent-managed containers, drydock proxies the log request through the agent connection automatically.

## Agent Log Viewer

Agent runtime logs are available from the **Agents** page. Open an agent's detail slide-in panel and switch to the **Logs** tab.
