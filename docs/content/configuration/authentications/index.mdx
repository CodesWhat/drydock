drydock allows `Anonymous` access by default.

You can enable 1 or multiple authentication strategies using `DD_AUTH_*` env vars.

<Callout type="warn">Please pay attention that all API routes & all UI views will be authenticated.</Callout>

Currently, the following strategies are supported:

<Callout type="info">[**Basic**](/docs/configuration/authentications/basic)</Callout>

<Callout type="info">[**Openid Connect**](/docs/configuration/authentications/oidc)</Callout>
